I'm a developer with a passion for Java and Kafka, certified in both. When I'm not coding, you'll find me in the kickboxing ring or catching waves on my surfboard during the summer. I'm also an amateur manga artist, working towards creating my own manga series (stay tuned...). 

Contributing to open source projects like Jhipster and LangChain4j is where I find fulfillment and joy. Let's collaborate and build something amazing together! 🤩
